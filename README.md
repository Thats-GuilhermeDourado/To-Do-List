# To-Do-List
The To-Do List application is a tool designed to help you organize your tasks. With a clean and modern and simple interface, users can easily add new tasks, edit existing ones, and delete tasks they no longer need. The app supports filtering tasks by their status, making it simple to focus on what needs to be done. (working in future atualizations)
